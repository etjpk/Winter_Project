🔹 Project Title
Stock Market Trend Predictor using Time Series Analysis and Transformer Models
1️⃣ What problem we worked on
We aimed to predict the next-day stock movement (Up / Down) using:
Historical stock price & volume data
Technical indicators
Market sentiment from news headlines
The goal was decision support, not exact price prediction.
2️⃣ Models used in the project
✅ Model 1: ARIMA (Baseline TSA Model)
Why used:
ARIMA is a classical Time Series Analysis (TSA) model
Provides a baseline to compare deep learning models against
Widely accepted in finance for trend modeling
What it used:
Only historical Close price
Assumes linear relationships
Performance:
Accuracy ≈ 52–53%
Struggles with market noise and non-linear patterns
📌 Conclusion:
ARIMA works as a reference model but is limited for complex financial data.
✅ Model 2: Transformer (Deep Learning Model)
Why used:
Captures long-term temporal dependencies
Handles non-linear patterns
Can use multiple features simultaneously
What it used:
OHLCV data
Technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
Sentiment score derived from news headlines(simulated daily financial news sentiment using VADER, aggregated it into a daily sentiment score, and stored it as a feature in the main dataset. This sentiment feature was used as input to the Transformer model to capture market emotion alongside technical indicators.)
Architecture highlights:
Time-series windowing (60 days)
Multi-feature input
Attention mechanism for temporal importance
Performance:
Accuracy ≈ 52–53%
Better recall for upward market movement
More stable than ARIMA in volatile periods
📌 Conclusion:
Transformer learned richer representations than TSA models, though limited by dataset size.
